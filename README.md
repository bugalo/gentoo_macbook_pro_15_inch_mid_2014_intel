# Gentoo configuration for a Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch (Mid. 2014) with Intel graphics.

This is my personal repository for the Gentoo configuration files of my Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch (Mid. 2014) with Intel graphics. I will also maintain another repository with Nvidia graphics (coming soon-ish).

If you are reading this, please keep in mind these are the configurations that, after many iterations, work for me, not necessary the best or the optimum. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
